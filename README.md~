Controlling the hypercube object:

There are a bunch of keyboard shortcuts for controlling the cube

If you hold down the delete key, the hypercube lets you adjust the slice
settings at runtime.  This is handy for switching between the beta display
and big cube without recompiling, and also for tweaking settings for new 
experimental displays
(all shortcuts in this section require you to hold the delete key)
* '1' -- preset for the big cube
* '2' -- preset for the beta
* 'w'/'s' -- nudge the slices up/down
* 'a'/'d' -- nudge the slices left/right
* 'e'/'q' -- increase/decrease the slice height
* 'x'/'z' -- increase/decrease the slice width

-------------------------------------

* calibration image * 
(you don't need to hold the delete key to use)

* 'c' toggles up the calibration image

-------------------------------------

hypercube motion controls (these are always enabled by default, no need to hold down the delete key)

* w/a/s/d moves forward/back (into and out of the screen) and left/right
* left Control/left Shift moves up and down
* q/e zooms in and out
* tab/r rolls
* mouse drag tilts and yaws
